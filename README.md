# TheGame
A prototype made for comp313 project 2.

Game concept & description

The key mechanics of the game is player as a ball to get into the goal container, player needs to figure out a way either by his jumping skills or using the resouces he could find to assist him, the current level only have planks put randomly on the map but in the future more mechanics could be added such as buttons to unlock certain areas on the map, portals to teleport player to another area, some powerups (some of the powerups are implemented in the other version of the prototype, linked below), and even some enemies. 

Player can press A and D or arrow keys to move left and right, press space for jump and Q to create launchpad, player only have 3 launchpad to use for one level at the moment but this may change in the future and he may also be able to pick up launchpad items to be used in the future. Player is able to adjust the directions of the launchpad to determine the direction of him to be launched, this is not implemented perfectly and have some flaws to be fixed in the future.

The ultimate goal is to put the ball into the container, which is too high for player to simply jump in, meaning player needs to at least save one launchpad for this final jump. The indication of winning for now is simply a message log in the console. 

As we mentioned the key mechanics is the interaction between player and launchpad, in the future there could be multiple levels with fewer and fewer planks but more different items to be used to increase the difficulty and depth of the game. Another approach is to have different ways of playing and interactions, such as the other version of the game as different levels, but keep the concept of jumping launchpad constantly flow in the game.

Installation & setup

Simply download the repository and import into unity to run. 

Challenges
This is the first time I am using unity and I found it confusing to start with, but after a few hours of play around I found it to be really fun. I had some problems dealing with the collision and bouncing detections, and adjusting and balancing the relationship with gravity scale, mass, and jump force.
